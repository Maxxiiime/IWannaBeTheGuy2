#I Wanna Be The Guy 2.0

## The game
This game was created as part of the Tutored Project for Semester 2 of my training (DUT Computer Science). We were in teams of 4, and we had one week to reproduce a retro game with the Qt IDE in C++. We chose to reproduce the game I Wanna Be The Guy, released in 2007. It is not the most retro game, but thanks to its 2D platform game side, it was still selected.
This game is a kind of Mario Bross in an "infuriating" version in fact, many traps are hidden in quite vicious ways. To you to discover them !
